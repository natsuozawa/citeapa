# Cite APA

Create an citation referencing a work to include in the **references** section of an essay in **APA style**.

## What is APA style?

**APA StyleÂ®** originated in 1929, when a group of psychologists, anthropologists, and business managers convened and sought to establish a simple set of procedures, or style rules, that would codify the many components of scientific writing to increase the ease of reading comprehension.

As with other editorial styles, **APA Style** consists of rules or guidelines that a publisher observes to ensure clear and consistent presentation of written material. It concerns uniform use of such elements as:
* selection of headings, tone, and length
* punctuation and abbreviations
* presentation of numbers and statistics
* construction of tables and figures, citation of references
* many other elements that are a part of a manuscript

## Features
This application allows the user to create a citation in **APA style**. The citation can be created by entering information by steps as requested by the UI.

### The Citation Process
1. Select the type of source you are going to cite.
2. Add any contributors (eg: authors, editors, translators) if there are any.
3. Add any information about the title and the publishing date of the source as required.
4. Add any information about the publication (eg: volume, issue, publisher, DOI/URL) as required.
5. Add any extra information if necessary.
6. Optionally add annotations.
7. Generate the citation.
8. Manually edit the citation to your likings, or copy and paste into your document.

### Autosave
**Autosave** was a feature that was implement in `v 0.3.2 [alpha]`. It has been tested to make sure that when you come back, your work will be back just as you left it. **Autosave** is enabled by default, however you can turn this feature off in the settings panel. Your saved data is stored on your local storage, and will be there as long as it is not deleted or reset. (Deleting cookies will not reset your data.)
